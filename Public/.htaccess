# Specify PHP Version
# Set PHP 7.4 as the version to handle .php files
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php74 .php

# URL Rewriting and Redirection
# Enable Apache's Rewrite Engine to support URL rewriting
RewriteEngine On

# Redirect all non-existent file and directory requests to index.php
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]

# Explanation:
# - RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f: If the requested file does not exist.
# - RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d: If the requested directory does not exist.
# - RewriteRule ^ index.php: Redirect everything to index.php.
# - [QSA]: Query string append; ensures the query string in the original request is added to the new URL.
# - [L]: Last rule, meaning no further rewrite rules will be applied.

# Security Headers
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    # Prevent MIME type sniffing to mitigate certain attacks
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"

    # Enable XSS protection
    Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"

    # Prevent clickjacking attacks by denying the page to be loaded in an iframe
    Header always set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
</IfModule>

# Security headers explained:
# - X-Content-Type-Options: Tells browsers to follow the MIME types set by the server, avoiding content-type sniffing.
# - X-XSS-Protection: Instructs the browser to enable built-in XSS protection.
# - X-Frame-Options: Protects the site from being embedded in an iframe, preventing clickjacking attacks.

# Deny Access to Sensitive Files

# Block external access to the .htaccess file itself
<Files .htaccess>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

# Deny access to the .env file (commonly used for environment variables)
<Files .env>
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
</Files>

# Deny access to composer files (composer.json and composer.lock)
<FilesMatch "^composer\.(json|lock)$">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

# File access restriction explained:
# - <Files .htaccess>: Blocks access to the .htaccess file itself for added security.
# - <Files .env>: Denies access to the .env file, which typically contains sensitive environment variables.
# - <FilesMatch "^composer\.(json|lock)$">: Matches and blocks access to the composer.json and composer.lock files to prevent exposing dependency information.
